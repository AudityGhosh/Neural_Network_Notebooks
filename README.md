# Neural Network Notebooks

This repository contains the lab works from the **Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic** course at **Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET)**. The notebooks implement various neural network algorithms and showcase practical applications of machine learning models.

### üß† Neural Network Algorithms Implemented:
- **K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**: Implementation of KNN from scratch and comparison with built-in KNN models.
- **Single Layer Perceptron**: Implementation of a simple perceptron model for binary classification tasks.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron**: A more advanced model involving multiple layers with backpropagation for training.

### üîç Key Files:
1. **K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**:
   - `K Nearest Neighbour Scratch vs Built-In on Breast Cancer Dataset.ipynb`: Comparison of KNN from scratch and built-in methods on the Breast Cancer dataset.
   - `Implement K Nearest Neighbour From Scratch and Compare with the Built-in Graphically.ipynb`: Visual comparison of custom vs built-in KNN.

2. **Single Layer Perceptron**:
   - `Single Layer Perceptron.ipynb`: Simple perceptron model to classify binary data.

3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**:
   - `Multi-Layer Perceptron & Backpropagation Binary Classifier.ipynb`: Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron and backpropagation algorithm for binary classification.

4. **Datasets**:
   - `Breast_Cancer_Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the KNN model.

### üöÄ How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AudityGhosh/Neural_Network_Notebooks.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd Neural_Network_Notebooks
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
    ```bash
